# Welcome to OpenAQM todo list
This document contains a list of all the steps needed to complete the development of OpenAQM firmware.

We will each pick an activity to work on, test and push to the repository. Once an activity is complete, remember to commit with a message that begins with:

1. The activity name.
2. The activity ID.
3. What you have accomplished, on the activity.
4. Mark the activity ID as done, or if the entire activity is completed, mark the activity as completed.

**REMEMBER:** 
> The firmware can't build itself.
